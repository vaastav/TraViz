\section{Tasks}

We have identified a total of six tasks that we want to support with our viz tool. These tasks
are finding outliers and providing an overview of the dataset, integrating tracing data to the source
code, analysing a single trace, understanding the dependencies between services in a distributed system,
comparing two traces, and aggregating multiple traces. Each task is clarified through an example below.

\textbf{Scenario 1: Overview and finding outliers}

A developer wants to find requests that are slower than usual in a distributed system. This information should be consumed by the developer,
so that a detailed analysis of the system can be conducted. For example, identifying unsually slow requests is useful at selecting what traces
should be further analyzed.

\textbf{Scenario 2: Integrating traces with the source code}

A developer wants to locate files that are highly active. This information can be used to understand what areas of the source code are responsible
for the activity in the system, and thus require more attention. These insights can be used to alert developers that new code to those files should
be thoroughly tested and reviewed, since it belongs to a critical part of the system. The developer should be directed to the source code once a file of
interest is identified.

\textbf{Scenario 3: Analyzing one trace}

A developer wants to have detailed information on a request. Tracing data can be consumed to reveal information such as the path of the request, the 
time the events in a request where triggered, and what threads executed a request. This information can reveal detailed system information that can be
used to optimize the code.

\textbf{Scenario 4: Finding service dependencies}

A developer wants to find how many services communicate with a specified service. This task entails locating the node in a graph representing the service of interest,
and following the links from that service to other services. This information can be used to identify the services in a microservice that are dependent in many other
services, which can be useful at helping developers what services should be refactored to minimize dependencies.

\textbf{Scenario 5: Aggregating traces}
