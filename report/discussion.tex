\section{Discussion}

We consider TraViz to be partially successful at the time of writing.
We believe that TraViz's exploration dashboard is a very good starting
point for the users to find potentially outlier traces and then select
such traces for further analysis. Additionally, as far as we know, TraViz
is the first visualization tool to integrate the static source code
information with dynamic performance information captured in the traces.
The current source code integration idiom is just a starting point
and we believe there are other interesting ways of visualizing and integrating
source code information with distributed traces.

We consider TraViz to only be partially successful as we believe
that the current graph comparison and aggregation tools are easily
usable or understandable. This is primarily due to the fact that
our current graph idioms don't have a good layout strategy for laying
out the nodes and edges on the screen causing our idioms to suffer from
the dreaded "hairball effect".
Finding a good layout strategy
is akin to finding a needle in the haystack but we believe
that we will eventually find one that fits our use case.
