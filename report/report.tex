\title{TraViz: Visualization of Traces in Distributed Systems}
\author{Vaastav Anand and Matheus Stolet}

\abstract{
    In this work we present TraViz, an interactive visualization tool for exploring and analysing 
    distributed traces to troubleshoot and debug performance problems in distributed systems.
    Through the use of composite filtering of multiple dimensions of the dataset, TraViz
    provides developers an easy to use way to find outlier traces. With TraViz's traceview
    swimlane idiom, the users can drill down into a single trace to analyze the trace
    for performance issues at the detail level of an operating system thread. TraViz's
    comparison idiom allows users to compare the Graphical structure of 2 traces of interest
    to highlight the key differences between the traces.
    The aggregation idiom allows users to find uncommon occuring events across traces by
    constructing a luminance coded super graph of all the distributed traces.
    Additionally, TraViz is the first visualization tool that provides an integrated view
    of the static source code of the system with dynamic information collected about the
    system via distributed traces which can help the users in identifying locations in the
    source code that would be ideal for performance optimizations.
