\section{Task}

For this project we want to focus on comparison tasks. Namely, we want to compare the path and performance of different
requests. Each one of our traces represents a request and the collection of events in one trace forms a directed acyclic graph. Our
comparison tasks are meant to compare the structure of the DAGs created by the events and the duration of different requests. 
We want to support three different comparison tasks: one trace against one trace, one trace against many traces, and many traces
against many traces. In more abstract terms, we will compare the DAGs formed by the events in different traces.
