\section{Implementation Approach}

Our visualization tool will be a webapp. We will host a backend written in Go that 
will serve requests from a client. The frontend will be written in javascript. We will use D3 to manipulate the data served
by our backend and to create the visualizations necessary to fulfill our comparison tasks.
